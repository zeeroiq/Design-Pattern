# Strategy
System behaviour partially specified at runtime. <br/>
-- More specifically, it enables the exact behavior of a system to be selected either at
runtime or at compile time.

Also known as a Policy Pattern in C++


can refer to the example of Tea making process same process can be used for Coffee.
the main behavior of the product is identified at the end while putting either coffee/tea.

# MARKDOWN FORMATTER
``// * SOMETHING`` 

# HTML FORMATTER
``<ul><li></li></ul>``

In the code base the default implementation is for dynamic Strategy, so the exact behavior is identified while
running the application.

#### Static Strategy
There is another implementation for the static strategy, here we force the application behavior to be known at
compile time. The code is available at branch `STATIC-STRATEGY`
